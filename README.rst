`Scrappy`` is a collection of tools used to generate Faraday spectra for various 
indpendent lines of sight across an extragalactic source. It began as a custom 
script for Pictor A field, but is now able to support any field provided a 
source mask is given.

It consists of a pipeline script `showrunner.sh` which perfroms multiple steps to
achieve this end goal.

Run:

`scrappy -i`

to avail the scripts required to run `showrunner`. This is a bash script that
can be modified to suit ones needs. When ready, it is ran as:

`./showrunner `

It's help is accessible as: `./showrunner -h`


`scrappy` package consists multiple scripts, which can be viewed using

`scrappy - h`

All these scripts are in use within the `showrunner`. They are:

- `sc-los`: To generate the independent sc-los
- `sc-losrm`: Perform RM-synthesis + RM-CLEAN on the LoS generated by `sc-los`
- `sc-rmmap`: Generate among other things, an RM map
- `sc-bokehplot`: Generate interactive plots for the LoS. These are for integration with `PolarVis`
- `sc-ifit`: A rudimentary script for fitting taylor polynomials to Stokes I

Each of the scripts has a help text that is accessible via the `-h` flag. 
Please consult that for more information on the parameters required to ran the individual scripts.
