### Introduction

This tool takes in the per-LoS pickle files generated by **sc-los-rm** as its inputs and generates each of their corresponding interactive plots. Hence, before using this tool, one first must run the following tools in order:

1. [sc-los](./sc-los.md)
2. [sc-los-rm](./sc-losrm.md)


Interactivity is achieved using the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) Python visualisation library which is an automatic dependency of Scrappy. The plots to be generated by default currently are specified in the `bk_plots.yml` file, which is automatically availed when scrappy is initialised (see [Getting started][getting-started]).

### Outputs
Because `sc-bokehplot` is run in conjunction with `sc-los` and `sc-los-rm`, its outputs are stored the output directory containing the `sc-los` outputs, whose default output directory name is `scrap-outputs`. The yielded files are not regular `*.(png|jpg|svg)` files, rather they **are `*.html` files which are viewed using a web-browser**, and not a normal image viewer. As such, they offer the interactivity availed by a normal web-page.

For example with a typical run using [showrunner][output-directory-structure], the output appears like:

<pre><code>
├── scrap-outputs              # Outputs from Los data generator
│   ├── <b style="color:red">bokeh-plots</b>            # Interactive plots generated by sc-bokeh-plots from sc-los-rm
|       ├── reg_1<b style="color:red">.html</b>
|       ├── reg_2.html
|       ├── ...
|       ├── reg_n.html
│   ├── los-data              
│   ├── los-rm-data           
│   ├── los-rm-data-plots     

</code></pre>

### Help Menu
The help menu is accessible using
```
sc-bokehplot -h
```

which gives the following output

Example

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -id I_DIRS [I_DIRS ...]
                        Input directories where the LoS data is contained
  --yaml YAMLS [YAMLS ...]
                        Yaml file containing the plots to be plotted.
  -od ODIR, --output-dir ODIR
                        Where to dump outputs
